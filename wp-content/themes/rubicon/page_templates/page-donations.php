					<p>Our philosophy is simple: we are a neighborhood Deli, so we get involved with the clubs, causes, events and people that make up our neighborhood. We do it because we know that the community supports us and we want to give something back.</p>

					<p>One of the ways we give back is through donations to area organizations. Each year we donate time, effort and sandwiches to the people that are trying to make a better neighborhood and a better world.
Use our Donation Form to see whether Rubicon Deli can help with your non-profit event. Please understand that we cannot fulfill every request as we receive hundreds each year. When the volume of requests keeps us from granting every one, we try to give priority to organizations supporting education and young homeless.</p>
